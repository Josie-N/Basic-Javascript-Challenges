// Access each student's record in the array, and print out the students name, 
// track, points, and achievements.

// The finished project should display a report containing a section with each 
// student's info: name at the top, and their track, points, and achievements.

// To do this, you'll need to use a loop.

// Loop through each element of the array, and build up a message that contains 
// all of the student records, then print that message to the page.

// The tricky part, is getting to the actual property value of each object.
// Remember, we can use dot notation to access a property of an object.
// For example, student.name, accesses the name property of an object name 
// student.

// But in this case, you'll be accessing array elements.
