### This repo contains some of my favorite vanilla JavaScript exercises, games and challenges that I've completed while learning this complex but magical language. ðŸ§™âœ¨


#### Why?

When first starting out as a beginner, I struggled to find basic, simple challenges that were appropriate for my skill level, so I decided to open my own repo and curate the ones that I thought made the most sense.

#### How?

I've added each small challenge in a separate file, and the more complex ones each in their own folder.
Each challenge has a solution and comments that walk you through my thought process. 

Have fun!
